Map files has the following structure:
1. KEYWORDS
2. MAP 
3. END tag

1. Keywords.
There are several keywords which allow to customize
map. First of all you can substitute features in map (i.e. replace certain char
with defined Map feature (see features.py).
SUBST keyword has following format:
SUBST=[char]=>[FEATURE1] [EVAL_CODE] [CALLABLE_FEATURE3:PARAMS]
    char - is the char in map to be replaced
    FEATURE1 - feature as described in features.py
    EVAL_CODE - some piece of code that can be evaluated using
    builtin eval() function. PLEASE NOTE, THAT EVAL_CODE CURRENTLY
    DISSALOW USAGE of SPACE SYMBOL (as it's used to separate SUBST
    definitions)
    if feature name is folowed by : (again, no spaces) then all text
    between : and next space treated as params to feature method (
    certainly if it accepts params)
    SUBST can occur multiple times for single map (it can even be
    declared inside map body)
    NOTE that SUBST are reseted for each new map, unless they're
    marked as global (GLOBAL_SUBST)
ORIENT keyword is used to tell the parser if map can be fliped
horizontaly or verticaly or rotate (swaping x and y).
Currentyl ORIENT supports only RANDOM (any other value does nothing)
NAME keyword is used to define a name for map (should be unique)
2. Map definition.
Map definition is lines of constant lenght, containing predefined
tiles symbols or those, defined using SUBST.
3. END.
End keyword is mandatory and tells parser that map definition ends.
